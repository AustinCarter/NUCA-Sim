/*
 * This module contains code to implement various cache-like structures.  The
 * user instantiates caches using cache_new().  When instantiated, the user
 * may specify the geometry of the cache (i.e., number of set, line size,
 * associativity), and supply a block access function.  The block access
 * function indicates the latency to access lines when the cache misses,
 * accounting for any component of miss latency, e.g., bus acquire latency,
 * bus transfer latency, memory access latency, etc...  In addition, the user
 * may allocate the cache with or without lines allocated in the cache.
 * Caches without tags are useful when implementing structures that map data
 * other than the address space, e.g., TLBs which map the virtual address
 * space to physical page address, or BTBs which map text addresses to
 * branch prediction state.  Tags are always allocated.  User data may also be
 * optionally attached to cache lines, this space is useful to storing
 * auxilliary or additional cache line information, such as predecode data,
 * physical page address information, etc...
 *
 * The caches implemented by this module provide efficient storage management
 * and fast access for all cache geometries.  When sets become highly
 * associative, a hash table (indexed by address) is allocated for each set
 * in the cache.
 *
 * This module also tracks latency of accessing the data cache, each cache has
 * a hit latency defined when instantiated, miss latency is returned by the
 * cache's block access function, the caches may service any number of hits
 * under any number of misses, the calling simulator should limit the number
 * of outstanding misses or the number of hits under misses as per the
 * limitations of the particular microarchitecture being simulated.
 *
 * Due to the organization of this cache implementation, the latency of a
 * request cannot be affected by a later request to this module.  As a result,
 * reordering of requests in the memory hierarchy is not possible.
